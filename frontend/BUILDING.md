# Quickstart Building

This repo contains source code JSX and related files for a singlepage webpage written in ReactJS. The project uses npm for dependencies and webpack for building.

Here's the short and sweet.
```
# Ensure npm is installed
sudo yum install npm

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run build and dev server
npm run dev

# Build production/optimized files
npm build

# Remove all build products
npm clean
```
